### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Festus Asiyanbi, a front-end junior engineer from Nigeria.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on JavaScript mini & sizable projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js from scratch.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Python
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about front-end development, I'll be more than glad to learn from you what I do not know!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy dabbling with my laptop and writing code. I dream about code sometimes, haha
